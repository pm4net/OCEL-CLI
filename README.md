# OCEL-CLI

A CLI tool to quickly convert and/or merge multiple OCEL files to the various different formats. Uses the [OCEL](https://github.com/pm4net/OCEL) library in the background.

# Supported formats

The OCEL standard is defined for both JSON and XML. Both include a validation schema that is used by the library to validate input.

An additional useful format is to store OCEL data in document databases such as MongoDB [2]. A very good alternative for .NET is [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/), which is an embedded NoSQL database that is similar to MongoDB. It allows writing to files directly and does not require a database server to use. Support for MongoDB will be evaluated in the future.

| XML           | Implemented   |
| LiteDB        | Implemented   |
| MongoDB       | TBD           |
